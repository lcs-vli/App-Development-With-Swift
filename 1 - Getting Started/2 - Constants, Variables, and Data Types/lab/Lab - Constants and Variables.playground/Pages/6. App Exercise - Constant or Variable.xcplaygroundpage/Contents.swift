 ## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
 - Name: The user's name
 - Age: The user's age
 - Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
 - Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
 - Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours
 */
let userName = "Victoria"
//the user name will note change so it's a constant
var userAge = 15
//the user's age will increase by 1 every year, so it's a variable
var stepsTakenToday = 3000
//the steps taken for each day is different each day
let goalStep = 10000
//the goal of steps will not change. It's a constant
var averageHeartRate = 80
//the average heart rate changes so it will update every 24 hours

/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
